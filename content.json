CMDebug is intended for developers creating batch files to run in CMD (the Windows default command processor) or TCC-RT (the free runtime version of TCC).CMDebug allows you to write and debug your batch scripts with the integrated graphical IDE. CMDebug includes tabbed edit windows and a sophisticated debugger with single stepping, breakpoints, syntax coloring, tooltips, bookmarks, and tabbed variable and watch windows. Windows batch file programming has never been easier or more powerful!You can use CMDebug to develop either CMD-compatible batch files (.BAT or .CMD), or TCC-RT-compatible scripts (.BTM). If you select the “TCC Syntax” option, CMDebug supports the full TCC-RT command set. If you select the “CMD Syntax” option, CMDebug will disable TCC-only internal commands, variables, and functions. Some internal CMD / TCC commands will also behave slightly differently or modify their display output in order to match CMD’s behavior more closely.Using CMDebug with TCC-RT allows you to create (and encrypt) scripts using the TCC command language, and then distribute them with the free TCC-RT runtime on an unlimited number of target machines.FeaturesCreate and debug your batch scripts with the integrated graphical IDE. The IDE includes tabbed edit windows and a sophisticated debugger with single stepping, breakpoints, syntax coloring, tooltips, bookmarks, tabbed variable and watch windows. Windows batch file programming has never been easier or more powerful!The TCC-RT scripting language is a massive superset of the Windows CMD shell, with 245+ internal commands, 400+ internal functions, and 300+ system variables. Almost all of the CMD command line commands (e.g. DIR, COPY, DEL, START, etc.) are enhanced with hundreds of additional options. And TCC adds more than 200 new commands. TCC-RT can usually do in one or two lines what requires dozens of CMD commands (if CMD can do it at all).The scripting language includes a complete set of extended flow control structures including IF-Then-Else, DO and FOR loops, SWITCH, subroutines, batch libraries, and more.When using TCC-RT syntax, most interactive commands (such as COPY, DEL, DIR, MOVE, REN, START, etc.) have command dialogs that allow you to select filenames and options and see your command line before executing it. The most powerful Windows command processor is also the easiest to use!Monitor your system’s hardware and software events, and execute commands when an event is triggered. You can monitor directory changes, the clipboard, event logs, Ethernet and WiFi connections, services, processes, and USB and Firewire connections.Environment variable substitution is greatly enhanced, including nested variables, delayed expansion, indirect variables, multidimensional array variables, and direct access to the system, user, and volatile variables in the registry.Select or exclude files by date, time, size, owner, and extended wildcards or regular expressions for extraordinary flexibility in file management.Specify multiple filenames for most file processing commands (i.e., COPY, DEL, DIR, MOVE, etc.), or optionally the name of a file that contains the filename arguments. (COPY even supports multiple targets as well as multiple sources.)Multiple types of I/O redirection are available, including redirecting and piping to STDERR, “in-process” pipes, “here-document” and “here-string” redirection, and Tee and Y pipe fittings.Send keystrokes to any application (console or GUI).TCC-RT includes internal compression and extraction commands for ZIP, 7ZIP, TAR, JAR, GZIP, and BZIP files.You can access FTP, TFTP and HTTP (including SSL and SSH) directories and files in all command processor file-handling commands (COPY, DEL, MOVE, etc.).Internal support is included for Perl, Lua, REXX, PowerShell, Python, Tcl/tk, and any Windows Active Scripting language. You can even combine multiple languages in your batch scripts.下载地址官网下载：https://jpsoft.com/downloads/v25/cmdebug.exe大眼仔原文链接城通网盘：https://t00y.com/file/3965089-415984544","categories":[{"name":"Tools","slug":"Tools","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/categories/Tools/"},{"name":"develop","slug":"Tools/develop","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/categories/Tools/develop/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Soft","slug":"Soft","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/tags/Soft/"},{"name":"develop","slug":"develop","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/tags/develop/"},{"name":"CMD","slug":"CMD","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/tags/CMD/"},{"name":"debug","slug":"debug","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/tags/debug/"}]},{"title":"PDF Password Remover","slug":"tools/office/PDFPasswordRemover","date":"2020-01-02T05:00:00.000Z","updated":"2020-01-02T05:15:39.983Z","comments":true,"path":"tools/office/PDFPasswordRemover/","link":"","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/tools/office/PDFPasswordRemover/","excerpt":"","text":"Mgosoft PDF Password Remover is a simple, stand-alone application that can be used to remove the security on Adobe Acrobat PDF files.

The “Find As you Type” function immediately opens a Listary browser window with a list of matching files, folders or apps.Disk SearchDisk Search let’s you quickly find files and folders across every drive on your system. Instead of Window’s default needing to select one drive at a time, simply open an Explorer window or start typing in an existing window, and Disk Search will find exactly what you’re looking for, on any drive attached to your system, at blazing fast speeds.Launch AppsOne of the most powerful and favorite benefits of Listary users is the Launch App feature. With two clicks of the Ctrl key, you can type the name of the program or application you want to open, or use a shortcode, click return, and Listary opens the program.For example click Ctrl twice, then type ‘Word’ and Listary will open Microsoft Word. Or, type ‘pp’ for PowerPoint, ‘ps’ for Photoshop, and voila! Listary opens the program!And it just gets better over time. Listary uses your launch and search history to refine and improve search results automatically, creating an even faster workflow the more you use it.Quick SwitchAre you tired of digging through a slew of open windows to work with files in a program? With Listary’s Quick Switch feature, just click Ctrl+G to instantly jump to the open folder of the file you’re working with.Actions &amp; Context MenusInside any Listary search menu, all you have to do to manipulate a selected file or folder is simply press the right-arrow key. Immediately you’ll see the file’s context menu pop up. From there all of Listary’s commands are at your fingertips. Fewer clicks means faster workflow!Favorites And HistorySomething long missing from Windows is the ability to quickly and easily access a selection of your favorite folders and a history of previously opened windows. Now with Listary’s Favorites &amp; History function, you can add folders to a Favorites section and browse window history with the click of a button for easy access. Just like the Bookmark function in your favorite web browser.CommandsKeep your workflow lighting fast and efficient!Using Listary’s Command functions, you can use a set of hot-key commands to quickly complete tasks such as Open Last Folder, Explore Current Folder, Copy Folder Path, Go To Application Folder, Export List to CSV, Show Hidden Files and more. All using a single click or key command.Web Search &amp; Website LaunchUsing the powerful Listary Keyword engine, you can type your search directly in Listary’s command window to launch a browser window for any website or search engine.Instead of clicking or tabbing over to a browser, all you have to do is click Ctrl twice to launch Listary and start typing your Keyword search. For example “gg how to write html” will open Google search results for “How to write html” in your favorite browser.Listary includes a plethora of keyword queries for popular sites such as Twitter, Facebook, Wikipedia, Youtube, Bing, Amazon, Google Maps and many more.MouseLike waving a wand to access whatever you need, Listary’s Mouse accessory lets you double-click anywhere in the Windows environment to open a power menu with all of your most frequently accessed files and folders, as well as disk menus. Or simply click the Ctrl key twice to open a Listary search toolbar on-screen.","categories":[{"name":"Tools","slug":"Tools","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/categories/Tools/"},{"name":"effcient","slug":"Tools/effcient","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/categories/Tools/effcient/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Soft","slug":"Soft","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/tags/Soft/"},{"name":"effcient","slug":"effcient","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/tags/effcient/"},{"name":"search","slug":"search","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/tags/search/"}]},{"title":"WGestures","slug":"tools/efficient/WGestures","date":"2019-12-03T05:06:54.000Z","updated":"2019-12-03T05:32:53.819Z","comments":true,"path":"tools/efficient/WGestures/","link":"","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/tools/efficient/WGestures/","excerpt":"","text":"官网http://www.yingdev.com/projects/wgesturesWGestures鼠标手势 for Windows.一个更简单, 更现代的全局鼠标手势, 支持Windows 7/8/10。简单高效停止浪费时间在琐碎操作上！WGestures让用户跳过琐碎细节，专注于重要的事物。WGestures包含大量预设手势精心设计的&quot;快速入门&quot;教程不言自明的设置界面\"搜\" Easy!搜索引擎是每个用户必不可少的工具，WGestures专门设计了\"Web搜索\"操作来简化搜索信息的流程。随时随地，一个手势就能搜索选中的文字。支持Google、百度和必应，以及自定义的搜索引擎。跟随直觉随着手势数量的增加，用户要记忆越来越多的手势，这是个头疼的问题。WGestures从用户角度出发，设计出了更符合直觉的方案。修饰键：让一个手势变为多个手势名提示：手势名称实时反馈到屏幕上，消除误操作触发角 & 摩擦边有了“触发角”功能，您只需将鼠标移到屏幕角落即可触发相应操作，快如闪电。“摩擦边”允许您用鼠标摩擦屏幕边缘来执行一些例行性的操作，比如锁屏、关机等。GitHubhttps://github.com/yingDev/WGestures下载地址https://share.weiyun.com/5Xu1RCn","categories":[{"name":"Tools","slug":"Tools","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/categories/Tools/"},{"name":"effcient","slug":"Tools/effcient","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/categories/Tools/effcient/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Soft","slug":"Soft","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/tags/Soft/"},{"name":"effcient","slug":"effcient","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/tags/effcient/"},{"name":"gestures","slug":"gestures","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/tags/gestures/"}]},{"title":"IDEA","slug":"tools/develop/IDEA","date":"2019-12-03T04:48:17.000Z","updated":"2020-03-11T05:32:31.454Z","comments":true,"path":"tools/develop/IDEA/","link":"","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/tools/develop/IDEA/","excerpt":"","text":"官方主页https://www.jetbrains.com/idea下载地址https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download破解教程IDEA 最新破解方法，支持2019.3.3，2020-02-24更新","categories":[{"name":"Tools","slug":"Tools","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/categories/Tools/"},{"name":"develop","slug":"Tools/develop","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/categories/Tools/develop/"}],"tags":[{"name":"IDE","slug":"IDE","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/tags/IDE/"},{"name":"Soft","slug":"Soft","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/tags/Soft/"},{"name":"develop","slug":"develop","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/tags/develop/"}]},{"title":"Wox","slug":"tools/efficient/Wox","date":"2019-11-29T09:52:41.000Z","updated":"2019-12-20T05:27:20.489Z","comments":true,"path":"tools/efficient/Wox/","link":"","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/tools/efficient/Wox/","excerpt":"","text":"官网http://www.wox.oneAn effective launcher for windowsA full-featured launcher, access programs and web contents as you type.

is Notepad++Notepad++ is a free (as in “free speech” and also as in “free beer”) source code editor and Notepad replacement that supports several languages. Running in the MS Windows environment, its use is governed by GPL License.Based on the powerful editing component Scintilla, Notepad++ is written in C++ and uses pure Win32 API and STL which ensures a higher execution speed and smaller program size. By optimizing as many routines as possible without losing user friendliness, Notepad++ is trying to reduce the world carbon dioxide emissions. When using less CPU power, the PC can throttle down and reduce power consumption, resulting in a greener environment.I hope you enjoy Notepad++ as much as I enjoy coding it.","categories":[{"name":"Tools","slug":"Tools","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/categories/Tools/"},{"name":"develop","slug":"Tools/develop","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/categories/Tools/develop/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Soft","slug":"Soft","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/tags/Soft/"},{"name":"develop","slug":"develop","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/tags/develop/"}]},{"title":"PanDownload","slug":"tools/office/download/PanDownload","date":"2019-10-28T13:05:47.000Z","updated":"2019-12-11T05:11:48.420Z","comments":true,"path":"tools/office/download/PanDownload/","link":"","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/tools/office/download/PanDownload/","excerpt":"","text":"官方主页http://pandownload.com","categories":[{"name":"Tools","slug":"Tools","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/categories/Tools/"},{"name":"Download","slug":"Tools/Download","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/categories/Tools/Download/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Soft","slug":"Soft","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/tags/Soft/"},{"name":"Download","slug":"Download","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/tags/Download/"}]},{"title":"GitHub常用命令","slug":"GitHub常用命令","date":"2019-10-23T12:38:36.000Z","updated":"2019-10-23T14:39:03.498Z","comments":true,"path":"GitHub常用命令/","link":"","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/GitHub%E5%B8%B8%E7%94%A8%E5%91%BD%E4%BB%A4/","excerpt":"","text":"1. 回滚到某一提交，并删除后续的提交记录git reset --hard cfec6ffgit push origin HEAD --force2. 回退到上一次commit的状态git reset --hard HEAD^3. 回退到任意版本git reset --hard &lt;commitid&gt;4. 放弃提交，不推送git reset --soft HEAD^仅仅是撤回commit操作，写的代码仍然保留HEAD^的意思是上一个版本，也可以写成HEAD~1撤回2次提交，可以使用HEAD~2--mixed不删除工作空间改动代码，撤销commit，并且撤销git add这个为默认参数，git reset --mixed HEAD^ 和 git reset HEAD^ 效果是一样的。--soft不删除工作空间改动代码，撤销commit，不撤销git add--hard删除工作空间改动代码，撤销commit，撤销git add完成这个操作后，就恢复到了上一次的commit状态。5. 将分支A的提交，推送到分支Bcheckout Bgit cherry-pick commitId[如果有冲突，解决冲突之后git addgit cherry-pick --continue]git push6. 合并分支时忽略指定文件.gitattributes中写入\"filename merge=ours\":config.xml merge=ours在根目录下运行命令行git config merge.ours.driver true更新本地分支与远程分支保持一致git remote update origin --prune7. 合并部分文件合并分支B中srv目录下的所有文件和view目录下的index.html文件到A分支git checkout Agit checkout B srv/** view/index.htmlsrv下有多层目录，故不能用srv/*","categories":[{"name":"Soft","slug":"Soft","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/categories/Soft/"},{"name":"GitHub","slug":"Soft/GitHub","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/categories/Soft/GitHub/"}],"tags":[{"name":"GitHub","slug":"GitHub","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/tags/GitHub/"},{"name":"Command","slug":"Command","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/tags/Command/"},{"name":"Soft","slug":"Soft","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/tags/Soft/"}]},{"title":"Win10","slug":"tools/system/Win10","date":"2019-09-05T08:23:58.000Z","updated":"2019-10-28T14:34:17.954Z","comments":true,"path":"tools/system/Win10/","link":"","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/tools/system/Win10/","excerpt":"","text":"https://xdown.org","categories":[{"name":"Tools","slug":"Tools","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/categories/Tools/"},{"name":"system","slug":"Tools/system","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/categories/Tools/system/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Soft","slug":"Soft","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/tags/Soft/"},{"name":"system","slug":"system","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/tags/system/"}]},{"title":"XDown","slug":"tools/office/download/XDown","date":"2019-09-05T08:23:58.000Z","updated":"2019-12-11T05:09:51.798Z","comments":true,"path":"tools/office/download/XDown/","link":"","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/tools/office/download/XDown/","excerpt":"","text":"官方主页https://xdown.org","categories":[{"name":"Tools","slug":"Tools","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/categories/Tools/"},{"name":"Download","slug":"Tools/Download","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/categories/Tools/Download/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Soft","slug":"Soft","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/tags/Soft/"},{"name":"Download","slug":"Download","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/tags/Download/"}]},{"title":"Hello World","slug":"hello-world","date":"2019-08-29T02:09:56.805Z","updated":"2019-08-28T01:19:30.691Z","comments":true,"path":"hello-world/","link":"","permalink":"https://www.jianwudao.com/hello-world/","excerpt":"","text":"Welcome to Hexo!
