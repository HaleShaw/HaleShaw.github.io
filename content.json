CMDebug is intended for developers creating batch files to run in CMD (the Windows default command processor) or TCC-RT (the free runtime version of TCC). CMDebug allows you to write and debug your batch scripts with the integrated graphical IDE. CMDebug includes tabbed edit windows and a sophisticated debugger with single stepping, breakpoints, syntax coloring, tooltips, bookmarks, and tabbed variable and watch windows. Windows batch file programming has never been easier or more powerful! You can use CMDebug to develop either CMD-compatible batch files (.BAT or .CMD), or TCC-RT-compatible scripts (.BTM). If you select the “TCC Syntax” option, CMDebug supports the full TCC-RT command set. If you select the “CMD Syntax” option, CMDebug will disable TCC-only internal commands, variables, and functions. Some internal CMD / TCC commands will also behave slightly differently or modify their display output in order to match CMD’s behavior more closely. Using CMDebug with TCC-RT allows you to create (and encrypt) scripts using the TCC command language, and then distribute them with the free TCC-RT runtime on an unlimited number of target machines. Features Create and debug your batch scripts with the integrated graphical IDE. The IDE includes tabbed edit windows and a sophisticated debugger with single stepping, breakpoints, syntax coloring, tooltips, bookmarks, tabbed variable and watch windows. Windows batch file programming has never been easier or more powerful! The TCC-RT scripting language is a massive superset of the Windows CMD shell, with 245+ internal commands, 400+ internal functions, and 300+ system variables. Almost all of the CMD command line commands (e.g. DIR, COPY, DEL, START, etc.) are enhanced with hundreds of additional options. And TCC adds more than 200 new commands. TCC-RT can usually do in one or two lines what requires dozens of CMD commands (if CMD can do it at all). The scripting language includes a complete set of extended flow control structures including IF-Then-Else, DO and FOR loops, SWITCH, subroutines, batch libraries, and more. When using TCC-RT syntax, most interactive commands (such as COPY, DEL, DIR, MOVE, REN, START, etc.) have command dialogs that allow you to select filenames and options and see your command line before executing it. The most powerful Windows command processor is also the easiest to use! Monitor your system’s hardware and software events, and execute commands when an event is triggered. You can monitor directory changes, the clipboard, event logs, Ethernet and WiFi connections, services, processes, and USB and Firewire connections. Environment variable substitution is greatly enhanced, including nested variables, delayed expansion, indirect variables, multidimensional array variables, and direct access to the system, user, and volatile variables in the registry. Select or exclude files by date, time, size, owner, and extended wildcards or regular expressions for extraordinary flexibility in file management. Specify multiple filenames for most file processing commands (i.e., COPY, DEL, DIR, MOVE, etc.), or optionally the name of a file that contains the filename arguments. (COPY even supports multiple targets as well as multiple sources.) Multiple types of I/O redirection are available, including redirecting and piping to STDERR, “in-process” pipes, “here-document” and “here-string” redirection, and Tee and Y pipe fittings. Send keystrokes to any application (console or GUI). TCC-RT includes internal compression and extraction commands for ZIP, 7ZIP, TAR, JAR, GZIP, and BZIP files. You can access FTP, TFTP and HTTP (including SSL and SSH) directories and files in all command processor file-handling commands (COPY, DEL, MOVE, etc.). Internal support is included for Perl, Lua, REXX, PowerShell, Python, Tcl/tk, and any Windows Active Scripting language. You can even combine multiple languages in your batch scripts. 下载地址 官网下载：https://jpsoft.com/downloads/v25/cmdebug.exe 大眼仔原文链接 城通网盘：https://t00y.com/file/3965089-415984544","categories":[{"name":"Tools","slug":"Tools","permalink":"http://www.jianwudao.com/categories/Tools/"},{"name":"develop","slug":"Tools/develop","permalink":"http://www.jianwudao.com/categories/Tools/develop/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Soft","slug":"Soft","permalink":"http://www.jianwudao.com/tags/Soft/"},{"name":"develop","slug":"develop","permalink":"http://www.jianwudao.com/tags/develop/"},{"name":"CMD","slug":"CMD","permalink":"http://www.jianwudao.com/tags/CMD/"},{"name":"debug","slug":"debug","permalink":"http://www.jianwudao.com/tags/debug/"}]},{"title":"PDF Password Remover","slug":"tools/office/PDFPasswordRemover","date":"2020-01-02T05:00:00.000Z","updated":"2020-01-02T05:15:39.983Z","comments":true,"path":"tools/office/PDFPasswordRemover/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.jianwudao.com/tools/office/PDFPasswordRemover/","excerpt":"","text":"Mgosoft PDF Password Remover is a simple, stand-alone application that can be used to remove the security on Adobe Acrobat PDF files.

To reveal your fence, you can move your mouse over the title-bar or double-click it again to view the title and all of its icons as normal. Desktop Pages Create multiple pages of fences on your desktop and quickly swipe between them. To change to a different desktop page, just take your mouse cursor to the edge of your screen and click and drag. Then a new page of fences will be displayed. This feature provides greater control over how you can organize favorite programs, documents, websites and more. Desktop Quick-hide Instantly clean up your desktop. Double-click any blank space on your desktop and your desktop icons will fade out. Double-click again and they will return. You can even pick icons and individual fences to exclude. Automatic desktop organization Define rules for how your icons are arranged on your desktop and Fences will automatically sort new icons into the fences you have chosen based on your rules. Folder portals Fences can act as a portal to any folder on your PC. For example, your documents or pictures folders can be mirrored onto your desktop as a fence enabling quick access to their contents without adding clutter to your desktop. Customize your Fences Quickly personalize the labels, background colors and transparency of your fences from the easy to use configuration menu.

The “Find As you Type” function immediately opens a Listary browser window with a list of matching files, folders or apps. Disk Search Disk Search let’s you quickly find files and folders across every drive on your system. Instead of Window’s default needing to select one drive at a time, simply open an Explorer window or start typing in an existing window, and Disk Search will find exactly what you’re looking for, on any drive attached to your system, at blazing fast speeds. Launch Apps One of the most powerful and favorite benefits of Listary users is the Launch App feature. With two clicks of the Ctrl key, you can type the name of the program or application you want to open, or use a shortcode, click return, and Listary opens the program. For example click Ctrl twice, then type ‘Word’ and Listary will open Microsoft Word. Or, type ‘pp’ for PowerPoint, ‘ps’ for Photoshop, and voila! Listary opens the program! And it just gets better over time. Listary uses your launch and search history to refine and improve search results automatically, creating an even faster workflow the more you use it. Quick Switch Are you tired of digging through a slew of open windows to work with files in a program? With Listary’s Quick Switch feature, just click Ctrl+G to instantly jump to the open folder of the file you’re working with. Actions &amp; Context Menus Inside any Listary search menu, all you have to do to manipulate a selected file or folder is simply press the right-arrow key. Immediately you’ll see the file’s context menu pop up. From there all of Listary’s commands are at your fingertips. Fewer clicks means faster workflow! Favorites And History Something long missing from Windows is the ability to quickly and easily access a selection of your favorite folders and a history of previously opened windows. Now with Listary’s Favorites &amp; History function, you can add folders to a Favorites section and browse window history with the click of a button for easy access. Just like the Bookmark function in your favorite web browser. Commands Keep your workflow lighting fast and efficient! Using Listary’s Command functions, you can use a set of hot-key commands to quickly complete tasks such as Open Last Folder, Explore Current Folder, Copy Folder Path, Go To Application Folder, Export List to CSV, Show Hidden Files and more. All using a single click or key command. Web Search &amp; Website Launch Using the powerful Listary Keyword engine, you can type your search directly in Listary’s command window to launch a browser window for any website or search engine. Instead of clicking or tabbing over to a browser, all you have to do is click Ctrl twice to launch Listary and start typing your Keyword search. For example “gg how to write html” will open Google search results for “How to write html” in your favorite browser. Listary includes a plethora of keyword queries for popular sites such as Twitter, Facebook, Wikipedia, Youtube, Bing, Amazon, Google Maps and many more. Mouse Like waving a wand to access whatever you need, Listary’s Mouse accessory lets you double-click anywhere in the Windows environment to open a power menu with all of your most frequently accessed files and folders, as well as disk menus. Or simply click the Ctrl key twice to open a Listary search toolbar on-screen.","categories":[{"name":"Tools","slug":"Tools","permalink":"http://www.jianwudao.com/categories/Tools/"},{"name":"effcient","slug":"Tools/effcient","permalink":"http://www.jianwudao.com/categories/Tools/effcient/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Soft","slug":"Soft","permalink":"http://www.jianwudao.com/tags/Soft/"},{"name":"effcient","slug":"effcient","permalink":"http://www.jianwudao.com/tags/effcient/"},{"name":"search","slug":"search","permalink":"http://www.jianwudao.com/tags/search/"}]},{"title":"WGestures","slug":"tools/efficient/WGestures","date":"2019-12-03T05:06:54.000Z","updated":"2019-12-03T05:32:53.819Z","comments":true,"path":"tools/efficient/WGestures/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.jianwudao.com/tools/efficient/WGestures/","excerpt":"","text":"官网 http://www.yingdev.com/projects/wgestures WGestures鼠标手势 for Windows. 一个更简单, 更现代的全局鼠标手势, 支持Windows 7/8/10。 简单高效 停止浪费时间在琐碎操作上！WGestures让用户跳过琐碎细节，专注于重要的事物。 WGestures包含大量预设手势 精心设计的&quot;快速入门&quot;教程 不言自明的设置界面 \"搜\" Easy! 搜索引擎是每个用户必不可少的工具，WGestures专门设计了\"Web搜索\"操作来简化搜索信息的流程。 随时随地，一个手势就能搜索选中的文字。 支持Google、百度和必应，以及自定义的搜索引擎。 跟随直觉 随着手势数量的增加，用户要记忆越来越多的手势，这是个头疼的问题。WGestures从用户角度出发，设计出了更符合直觉的方案。 修饰键：让一个手势变为多个 手势名提示：手势名称实时反馈到屏幕上，消除误操作 触发角 & 摩擦边 有了“触发角”功能，您只需将鼠标移到屏幕角落即可触发相应操作，快如闪电。 “摩擦边”允许您用鼠标摩擦屏幕边缘来执行一些例行性的操作，比如锁屏、关机等。 GitHub https://github.com/yingDev/WGestures 下载地址 https://share.weiyun.com/5Xu1RCn","categories":[{"name":"Tools","slug":"Tools","permalink":"http://www.jianwudao.com/categories/Tools/"},{"name":"effcient","slug":"Tools/effcient","permalink":"http://www.jianwudao.com/categories/Tools/effcient/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Soft","slug":"Soft","permalink":"http://www.jianwudao.com/tags/Soft/"},{"name":"effcient","slug":"effcient","permalink":"http://www.jianwudao.com/tags/effcient/"},{"name":"gestures","slug":"gestures","permalink":"http://www.jianwudao.com/tags/gestures/"}]},{"title":"IDEA","slug":"tools/develop/IDEA","date":"2019-12-03T04:48:17.000Z","updated":"2019-12-03T05:00:28.797Z","comments":true,"path":"tools/develop/IDEA/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.jianwudao.com/tools/develop/IDEA/","excerpt":"","text":"官方主页 https://www.jetbrains.com/idea 下载地址 https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download 破解教程 IDEA 最新破解方法，支持2019.3，2019-12-02更新","categories":[{"name":"Tools","slug":"Tools","permalink":"http://www.jianwudao.com/categories/Tools/"},{"name":"develop","slug":"Tools/develop","permalink":"http://www.jianwudao.com/categories/Tools/develop/"}],"tags":[{"name":"IDE","slug":"IDE","permalink":"http://www.jianwudao.com/tags/IDE/"},{"name":"Soft","slug":"Soft","permalink":"http://www.jianwudao.com/tags/Soft/"},{"name":"develop","slug":"develop","permalink":"http://www.jianwudao.com/tags/develop/"}]},{"title":"Wox","slug":"tools/efficient/Wox","date":"2019-11-29T09:52:41.000Z","updated":"2019-12-20T05:27:20.489Z","comments":true,"path":"tools/efficient/Wox/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.jianwudao.com/tools/efficient/Wox/","excerpt":"","text":"官网 http://www.wox.one An effective launcher for windows A full-featured launcher, access programs and web contents as you type.

之前因为VPS没续费，域名备案也被注销了，紧跟着七牛云的CDN也被注销了，简直是让人忧伤！ 在网上找了好多图床，想代替掉七牛云。 最终选中了路过图床(imgchr)，上传图片不压缩，图片大小支持也很大，操作也方便，比较满意。 不过用了几天，发现绝大部分（目前还没发现有支持的）图床，似乎都不支持ico文件。 后面看到了JsDelivr，于是想着不如直接弄个所有文件仓库的CDN了。 教程 新建GitHub仓库 登录/注册GitHub，新建一个仓库。 生成Token 点击头像→Settings→Developer settings→Personal access tokens→Generate new token 填写“Note”，勾选“repo”，点击“Generate token”，生成Token。 注意： Token只会显示一次，一定要记录下来，后面会用到。 配置GipGo 下载PicGo，安装完成后开始配置图床。 仓库名：用户名/仓库名 分支名：master Token：之前生成的Token 存储路径：如“img/”，则会在仓库中创建名为img的文件夹，图片会储存在此文件夹中 自定义域名： 12在图片上传后，PicGo会按照“自定义域名+上传的图片名”的方式生成访问链接，放到粘贴板上。为了通过JsDelivr给GitHub仓库中的资源做CDN，所以自定义域名可以设置为：“https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/用户名/仓库名”
